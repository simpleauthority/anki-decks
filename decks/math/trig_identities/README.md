This deck contains all of the trigonometric identities shown on the second page of [this document by Hancock College](https://www.hancockcollege.edu/mathcenter/documents/Trigonometry.pdf).

Use it to learn your identities. It not only contains cards going one direction, but the other direction as well.

For example, there is a card for this pair of cofunction identities:

1. `sin(pi/2 - x) = cos(x)`  **and**  `cos(x) = sin(pi/2 -x)`
